  title: Pismo Account & Transaction Service
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    A minimal Pismo-like service implementing account creation and financial transactions
    using Hexagonal Architecture, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

    ## Business Rules

    - Accounts:
      - Identified by `account_id`
      - Created with a unique `document_number`

    - Transactions:
      - Each transaction belongs to an existing account.
      - `operation_type_id`:
        - 1 = CASH_PURCHASE        (amount stored as negative)
        - 2 = INSTALLMENT_PURCHASE (amount stored as negative)
        - 3 = WITHDRAWAL           (amount stored as negative)
        - 4 = PAYMENT              (amount stored as positive)
      - Clients must send `amount >= 0`.
      - The service applies the sign rules internally.
      - In responses, `amount` is returned with its final signed value.

          - 3 = WITHDRAWAL           → amount stored as negative
          - 4 = PAYMENT              → amount stored as positive
        - Client must send `amount >= 0`. The service will apply the correct sign.
        - Response returns the persisted transaction with its final signed `amount`.
